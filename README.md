##I learned exporting, utilizing node package management, command line prompts and more!

##After developing a question bank, I used inquirer to create a series of questions and have them display on the command prompt. After exporting the user input, it takes and exports to a generate Markdown file where it combines all of the markdown information and puts it together and reexports to the index file for README.md file generation.

##To complete, fill in the questions provided by the command prompt. Upon completion of the questions, a new file will be generated with all of the answers the user put into the command prompt in the correct README format.
